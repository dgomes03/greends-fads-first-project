5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
This copy command goes to a level up in the directory and copies everything that begins with "temp-". This is done because all of our files begin with "temp-", making it much more efficient than typing each one individually.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
We didn't need to run git init because this folder was cloned from github, so it is already initialised.


5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
I used the command: git commit * -m "initial commit".
